<h2><a name"presentation">Presentation</a></h2>
<p>JFormValidate is a Yii extension dedicated to provide <b>J</b>avascript <b>F</b>orm <b>V</b>alidation feature, for the Yii framework. This extension relies on an existing
JQuery plugin that provides all the logic and functionnalities for the actual client-side Form validation. It is a powerful plugin, with plenty of intresting features
that are described in its <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation" title="Validate JQuery plugin">official documentation</a>. </p>




<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Yii framework 1.1.0 or more. </li>
</ul>
<span style="color:red">Please note that previous version of Yii are not supported by this version of the extension. For the 1.0x Branch of Yii, the latest available
release of <b>jformvalidate</b> is v 1.0.0.9 that can be download from the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/jformvalidate/#download">Yii Extension Repository</a><br/>
It is not maintained anymore.</span>
<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The released archive contains following files and folders :
<div id="zipContent">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>jformvalidate.zip</b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>extensions</b> : the JFormValidate Yii extension itself including its dependencies. Note that the
				JQuery Validate Plugin is provided in this release.</li>
				<li><b>sampleApp</b> : this folder contains a set of files that can be added to a skeleton
				Yii app in order to demonstrate some functionalities of the JFormValidate extension. Most of these examples are available
				on the demo site.
					<ul>
						<li><b>controllers</b> : JsvformController controller</li>
						<li><b>models</b> : TestForm model, derived from CFormModel</li>
						<li><b>views</b>
							<ul>
								<li><b>jsvform</b> : this folder contains a set of view built from the
								TestForm model and aim to illustrate some aspects of the JFormValidate extension</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
</p>
<h3>Install the extension in an existing webApp</h3>
<ol>
	<li>copy the content of the <i>jformvalidate.zip/extensions</i> folder into <i>yourwebApp/protected/extensions</i></li>
	<li>Declare and initialize the new component in your application's configuration file.
	<pre>
    'jformvalidate' => array (
    	'class' => 'application.extensions.jformvalidate.EJFValidate',
     	'enable' => true
    ),</pre>
	</li>
	<li>import the EHtml helper class. <strike>This step is optional, as you could use the extension be refering directly to it
	as a loaded component</strike>. Since version 1.1, <b>EHtml</b> is the only way to use this extension.
 <pre>
    'import'=>array(
       ...
       'application.extensions.jformvalidate.EHtml',
       ...
     ) 	
 </pre>		
	</li>
</ol>	
<p>Now, the extension will be loaded the first time it is needed, but of course it is also possible to add it
to the <i>preload</i> sequence. <br/>The '<b>enable</b>' initialization argument (default to <em>true</em>) can be used to 
easely enable/disable the jformvalidate extension.<br/>
For more information on extensions, please refer to the 
<a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/extension.use#application-component" title="using extensions">Yii Documentation.</a>  </p>
<h3>Install samples</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Starting from a fresh Yii skeleton application, copy the content of  <i>jformvalidate.zip/sampleApp</i>
		into <i>yourApp</i> main folder.</li>
		<li>in your favorite browser access to <i>http://yourdomain/yourApp/index.php?<b>r=Jsvform/TestForm</b></i></li>
	</ul>
	You can now tests some features with the different forms provided as sample.
</p>

<h2><a name="quickstart">Quickstart</a></h2>
<p>Ok, let's see it in action ! For this first example, and assuming that the extension is correctly installed, we'll add Javascript validation 
to the Contact form that is automatically created with Yii skeleton application.<br/>
This only requires to modify the corresponding view file, as describes below :</p>
<ol>
	<li>edit the view file <em>protected/views/site/contact.php</em></li>
	<li>with your favorite search and replace tool, replace all occurences of<br/>
	<pre>CHtml</pre>
	with
	<pre>EHtml</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it ! The contact form is now validated on the client side, according to the rules defined by the corresponding Yii model. Of course
there are some configuration and CSS to set up in order to get a nice design, but the form validation is up and ready.</p>


<h2><a name="how">How does it work ?</a></h2>
<p>The EHtml class wraps all helper static methods from the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/CHtml" class="api" title="Yii class reference">CHtml</a> Yii core class, and by doing so, collects information
 on the form that is being built. When the <i>endForm()</i> method is invoked, all this information is used to generate a javascript initialisation object 
 for the JQuery Plugin validation. Therefore, this extension can be considered as some sort of adaptater/converter between validation rules defined by
 a Yii model, and validation rules implemented by the JQuery Validate plugin.</p>
 <h2><a name="upgrade">Upgrade from 1.0.x</a></h2>
 <p>
 	This version supports Yii 1.1 Branch but very few changes (if not no changes at all) must be done on your forms to be able to work
	fine with it.
	<ul>
		<li>scenario : to follow Yii scenario handling changes, the call to <b>EHtml::setScenario() is not needed anymore</b> as the extension
		directly gets the scenario from the model itself.</li>
		<li>dependencies : in order to reduce dependencies between <i>jformvalidate</i>  and the CHtml helper class, almost all calls
		to CHtml methods have been removed from the EJFValidate application component. This has 2 cosequences:
		<ul>
			<li><b>EHtml class is now the only way</b> to use this extension. In other words, if you used to call 
<pre>
Yii::app()->jformvalidate->activeTextField($model,'username');
</pre>			
				that is you were using the application component and not the EHtml class, you must now call :
<pre>
EHtml::activeTextField($model,'username');
</pre>			
				and use the EHtml class !				
			</li>
			<li>If you want to replace CHtml with another class you will have to modify EHtml.php and make it
			inherit this new class, but please note that following methods are invoked from the EJFValidate application component :
			 CHtml::activeName(), CHtml::activeId, CHtml::encode and CHtml::normalizeUrl()</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
  <h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
 <p>
 	Please note that method and class based validators are not supported by this extension, as it is not possible to <i>automatically</i>
	produce a JS code from a specific piece of PHP code (if you know how to do it, be my guess).
 </p>
 <p>In this version, the following set of Yii built-in validators is supported :
 <ul>
 	<li>required</li>
	<li>length : min, max or both</li>
	<li>email</li>
	<li>url</li>
	<li>compare : with another attribute (compareAttribute) or a constant value (compareValue)</li>
	<li>numerical : with options <i>integerOnly, min, max, tooBig, tooSmall</i></li>
	<li>match : note that pattern modifiers are not supported, except for /i</li>
 </ul>
 Consequently, if you use another rule in your model, it will not be tested on the client-side, it will have to be added manually. 
 </p>
 <h2><a name="using">using a JS validator</a></h2>
 <p>
 	If you need to validate user inputs on the client side, with a rule that is not (yet) implemented by this extension
	you can do so, by using the <i>pseudo validator</i> provided with the extension.<br/>
	This validator is a standard Yii validator class (it inherits from <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/CValidator">CValidator</a>) but it is describes as <i>pseudo</i>	
	because its only goal is to wrap calls to Javascript validators which are part of the underlying JQuery plugin. 
	Therefore, when the pseudo validator is called by the Yii framework to validate an attribute, it <b>always return true</b>.
 </p>
 <p>
 	Let's take a look at an example. The JQuery Plugin has a validator rule called <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/remote#options" title="view documentation">remote</a> which
	is used to validate a user entry through an ajax call to the server. So, let's say we want the user to enter his/her email, and that this email must not be already in use (this 
	rule is equivalent of the Yii unique rule). The initialisation value for the remote validator, is the url that is in charge of testing email unicity. <br/>
	In the model, we add the following rule :
	<pre>
array('custom1', 'application.extensions.jquery-form-validator.ECustomJsValidator',
	'rules'    => array(
		'remote' => 'index.php?r=Jsvform/remoteValidate'
	),
	'messages' => array(
		'remote' => '{attribute} already registred'
	)
),</pre>
  ..and that's it. Ok, you have to add the <b>actionRemoteValidate()</b> method to the <i>JsvformController</i>, but that's an easy task.
  <br/><i>(check <?php echo CHtml::link('this demo form',array('jsvform/TestForm', 'id'=>7));?> or form7.php provided in the sample webapp)</i>
 </p>
 <p>
 	As you can see in the example above, the <b>ECustomJsValidator</b> class accepts a rule and a messages parameters, as described by the JQuery Plugin
	 documentation.
 </p>
 
  <h2><a name="ajaxsub">Ajax submition</a></h2>
 <p>
 	Implementing ajax submition with client-side validation is simple, as it doesn't require anything else
	than what is required by Yii ! A call to EHtml::ajaxSubmitButton() is enough to inform the Extension that 
	ajax submition is needed. When this function is invoked, the JFormValidate extension will handle javascript 
	creation and event handler registration instead of Yii.<br/>
	For a complete example, take a look at sample form13 and form14.
 </p>
 
 <h2><a name="error">Error messages</a></h2>
 <p>In case an input field is not valid on the client-side, an error message is displayed. This error message comes from :
 	<ol>
 		<li>the message parameter from the rule, as it is defined in the model</li>
		<li>when a Yii built-in validator is used, and no message is set as rule parameter, the default error message is used</li>
		<li>when a client-side-only validator is used, then a message defined in the javascript source code is displayed</li>
 	</ol>
	You may also note that in the two first cases, the special placeholder {attribute} will be replaced by the name or the label of the attribute whose
	validation failed.
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 <h2><a name="api">API Description</a></h2>
 <h3>Initialisation</h3>
<p>In the configuration file, it is possible to set some initialization parameters.
<ul>
	<li><b>pluginOptions</b> : this option should contains an array off options that will be passed with no
	change, to the JQuery Plugin. For more information on these options, please refere to the 
	<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions">"Options for the validate() method"</a> page.</li>
	<li><b>enable</b> : (boolean) - this option can be used to quickly disable all client-side validation handled by this extension.</li>
</ul>
</p>
	<h3>Public Methods</h3>
 <p>In this version of the extension, only a reduced set of the Yii CHtml helpers methods have been wraped. 
 <ul>
 	<li>form element
		<ul>
			<li>form and beginForm</li>
			<li>endForm</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>form construction
		<ul>
		 	<li>activeCheckBox</li>
			<li>activeCheckBoxList</li>
			<li>activeDropDownList</li>
			<li>activeListBox</li>
			<li>activePasswordField</li>
			<li>activeRadioButtonList</li>
			<li>activeTextArea</li>
			<li>activeTextField</li>
			<li>ajaxSubmitButton</li>				
		</ul>		
	</li>
 </ul> 	
 </p>
 <p>The JFormValidate extension provides also specific methods to perform specific tasks.
 	<ul>
 		<li><b>setOptions(<i>array</i>)</b> : the arrays passed as argument should contain options that will be 
		passed to the JQuery Plugin (<i>see pluginOptions above</i>).These options will override the ones defined
		by the application configuration, providing you with more flexibility.</li>
		<li><b>setScenario(<i>string</i>)</b> : use this method in the view where your form is built so to set the
		name of the Yii scenario.The JFormValidate extension will use this name to select rules that
		apply to this scenario only.</li>
		<li><b>endForm()</b> : this is the method that produces the javascript initialisation code for the JQuery Validate plugin. If you
		don't invoke this method, no javascript validation will occur. This method returns the form closing element "&lt;/form&gt;"<br/>
		<em>Since Yii version 1.0.5, this method has been added to CHtml helper class</em></li>
 	</ul> 	
 </p>
 <h3>Overloading the submit handler</h3>
 <p>
 	The JQuery Validate plugin allows to overload the submit default handler (<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#options">see related documentation</a>).
	If you choose to do so, you must include a call to <b>$.fn.EJFValidate.restoreName(</b>) in your own submit hanlder. This javascript function is provided with the extension because a call to some CHtml
	helpers method, generates HTML input elements with duplicated names. The problem is that the JQuery Validate Plugin works with input elements names, and duplicates name
	are not welcomed. The Extension will temporary remove duplicate name, and they must be restores before form submition. That's what the <b>restoreName</b> javascript
	function does.
	Below is an example of how is it possible to overload the submit handler :
	<pre>
&lt;?php	
echo EHtml::beginForm(); 

EHtml::setOptions(array(
	
	// ... put other options here ...
		
	'submitHandler' => 'function(form){
		$.fn.EJFValidate.restoreName();
		alert("submting the form");
	}'
));
?&gt;
</pre>
	Check the sample form7 and form8 for live examples.	
 </p>
 <p>Note that starting from version 1.0.4, all customizable hanlders available in the JQuery Validate Plugin options, can 
 be overloaded with the same principle. This can be done at the form level (like in the example above) and of course at the 
 configuration level, in your application configuration file, when declaring the <b>EJFValidate</b> extension.
